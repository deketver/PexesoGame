# Pexeso game

## Game setup

In the main setup menu, it is possible to select the size of the board and what kind of game you want to play: as a **Single Player**, **Double Player**, or to play
as two players and use **Connection via Network**.
- **Single Player** - a player plays against an automatic player, which has always only one try, even though it scores successfully.
- **Double Player** - two players play against each other from one shared computer
- **Connect via network** - allows users to setup address and port to enable playing the game via network. One of the users selects the size of the board and sends
this as an information to the other player. Careful navigation as the programm is saying is needed.

## Playing the game

In order to start the game, it is necessary to press the 'Start' button, then the first player starts to play and scores start to count.
When playing over the network, each player sees himself/herself as a 'Player 1', but receive different instructions.
Pressing the button 'Reset' starts a new game with new set of cards.
